      <p>Data refers to unprocessed alphanumeric values obtained through various acquisition methods. In their most basic form, data comprises raw alphanumeric values. 
        Conversely, information is the product of processing, organizing, or structuring data to provide context and significance. Essentially, information is the 
        outcome of processed data. Knowledge, however, represents our comprehension. It is unique to each individual and is influenced by their past experiences and 
        insights, which shape how they interpret and assign meaning to information. To translate knowledge into action, an individual must possess the authority and 
        capability to make and implement decisions. Both knowledge and authority are necessary to generate actionable information that can have an impact.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu1" class="tab-pane fade">
      <p>Quantitative data is numerical information, including counts and numbers, that has a unique value for each data set. Researchers can use this data for mathematical 
        computations and statistical analysis, which allows them to make informed decisions in real-life situations based on these mathematical conclusions. 
        Quantitative research is the process of collecting and analyzing numerical data. It can be used to find patterns and averages, make predictions, 
        test causal relationships, and generalize results to wider populations.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade">
      <p>Qualitative data refers to non-numerical information that provides researchers with a detailed and nuanced understanding of human experiences, behaviors, 
        perceptions, and attitudes. Unlike quantitative data, which focuses on measurable factors, qualitative data explores the essence and complexity of phenomena 
        through descriptive and interpretive methods. You would use qualitative data to help answer questions like who your customers are, what issues or problems 
        they're facing, and where they need to focus their attention, so you can better solve those issues.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu3" class="tab-pane fade">
      <p>The sequential exploratory design approach involves first collecting and analyzing qualitative data, followed by using quantitative data to confirm or 
        authenticate the qualitative findings. For instance, a study on the difficulties encountered by low-income families could use interviews to gather 
        qualitative data on the barriers to healthcare access, and then use surveys to obtain quantitative data on the frequency of these obstacles.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu4" class="tab-pane fade">
      <p>When conducting quality assurance for web design, it is essential to take into account the specific needs and preferences of the user, which are known 
        as user requirements. The process of gathering user requirements involves utilizing different techniques like surveys, interviews, and focus groups. 
        After identifying the user requirements, it is crucial to create a website requirements document that encompasses a checklist of acceptance criteria for 
        each requirement.</p>
